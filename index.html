        <h2>Ayesha Rowe</h2>
        <p>My name is Ayesha Rowe and I love singing, dogs, drawing portraits and painting landscapes. I like web development because it allows me to express my artistic side through designing web pages. It improves my problem solving skills by tackling challenges and then finding solutions, which is a very rewarding feeling and leaves me satisfied. The web development community is a vibrant and supportive one which offers plenty of resources and working opportunities for the future. Technology is an ever evolving resource, so thereâ€™s always something new to learn. Web development has completely changed the way we interact with people, putting services and knowledge at our fingertips. It promotes innovation and economic progress by enabling companies and individuals to establish internet presences. Furthermore, web development promotes worldwide community building, advocacy, and communication, all of which contribute to social change.</p>
